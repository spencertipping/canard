nb[ This library provides trivial functions to iterate over numeric quantities. ]

= '#* [? [#* - 1 ^1 [^1 [.] %0]] [%% 2 []] %0]

  nb [#* n [f] x -> #* (n-1) [f] f x
      ^1 [^1 [.] %0] n [f] x   = n [f] f x
      #* - 1         n [f] f x = #* (n-1) [f] f x

      #* 0 [f] x -> x
      %% 2 [] 0 [f] x = x]
