# Numbers

It is philosophicall tempting to exclude numbers from the core Canard image;
parsing numeric literals is a pain and it's unclear that they couldn't be
implemented in some other way. Including numbers in the core image is a special
case of providing reader macros, or at the very least, generating definitions
from a subset of undefined symbols. (!!!)
